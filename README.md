# WashU_projects
Every projects I create is during the Washingtong University Study Period, and I would like to share with you.

Project 1: Bass Model
in the new product diffusion model (BASS MODEL), I create a package ("BASS_MODEL") with a module "Bass" wrapping up an object, "BASS". 

HOW TO USE IT?
Step 1: download it
Step 2: call it by: from BASS_MODEL.Bass import BASS
Step 3: dataframe = BASS(p,q,m,period=30)
Step 4: dataframe.continuous() # you also can output discrete or repeat purchase result
