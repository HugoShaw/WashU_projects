sterrenkundige waarnemer hiermee ontstond de tweede universiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld aert jansz de eerste waarnemer en zijn opvolgers voerden de utrechtse sterrenkunde de daaropvolgende jaren decennium en eeuwen naar de voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek dit jaar het jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond de huidige generatie utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten sterrenkunde verenigd het sterrekundig instituut utrecht vieren de benoeming van hun oervader middels een breed scala aan feestelijke activiteiten zo er voor scholieren een planetenproject programmeert de studium generale een aantal voordrachten meet een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de dy natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt er staat echter meer op stapel studenten natuur en sterrenkunde kunnen op april aan een sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen de onderwerpen van het symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het huidige utrechtse onderzoek het onderzoek aan de zogeheten compacte objecten de eindstadia de evolutie van sterren bij de samenstelling van het programma getracht de deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van de stand van zaken het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia de eerste inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof lamers een beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren waarna de zeven overige sprekers lezingen van telkens een half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten zullen ingaan na afloop van elke lezing er gelegenheid tot het stellen van vragen het dagprogramma staat
